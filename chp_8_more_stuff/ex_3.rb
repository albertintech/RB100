# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# IIRC, exception handling is a way to check that code functions as intended. In Java, there are try & catch blocks inserted into code to "catch" certain errors or abberations.

# Launch School answer:
# Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occurring in a program. It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.

# So I was missing the idea of changing flow of control in order to prevent exiting the program entirely.
