# Write a method that takes a string as an argument. The method should return a new, all-caps version of the string, only if the string is longer than 10 characters. Example: change "hello world" to "HELLO WORLD". (Hint: Ruby's String class has a few methods that would be helpful. Check the Ruby Docs!)

# caps_method.rb

def caps(string)
  if string.length > 10
    string.upcase
  else
    string
  end
end

puts caps("Joe Smith")
puts caps("Joe Robertson")
